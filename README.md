## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I developed a structured HTML design for a personal card, including essential details and links to social media.
I applied CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance and responsiveness of the personal card.

I implemented responsive design principles to ensure a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


### Continued development

Although I implemented basic responsive design principles, I wish to delve into more advanced strategies to ensure a seamless experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
I will seek opportunities to collaborate with other developers and participate in code reviews. This will not only enhance my skills but also provide valuable insights into best practices and coding styles.
